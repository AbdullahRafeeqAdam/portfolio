                    and GPT can build websites in 2024. But what sets me apart from others and AI is design and
                    creativity.

                    <p>My cousin operates a footwear business in the United States as a side hustle, at the age of 22.
                        Initially, I developed a website for his business as a personal project, providing my services
                        for free. However, the subsequent impact of this website has been noteworthy: his sales have
                        experienced a notable surge of 40%. It appears that the establishment of an online presence has
                        enhanced his credibility in the eyes of clients.</p>

                    <h2>Gym Website</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was at the gym, doing heavy lifts as usual (lying), when the rain knocks out the power. With
                        nothing else to do, I start chatting with the gym owner. I was curious about how profitable the
                        gym business is in Pakistan, something I've been thinking about myself. But his answer surprises
                        me. "It's tough," he says. "People are unreliable with payments, and the old pen-and-paper
                        system leads to scams ". Wanting to help out, I decide to create a website for the gym. It'll
                        make keeping track of payments and due dates much easier. And I didn't charge a cent for it.Why
                        did I do it? Well, I'm really interested in the gym business, and having access to all the data
                        will help me make smart decisions when I start my own gym someday. Because, you know, data is
                        important for the future.</p>

                    <h2>Portfolio Website</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>It might sound weird, but I've included my own portfolio site within my portfolio. You might be
                        questioning the wisdom behind this decision. Allow me to clarify. Why do businesses invest in a
                        website? To effectively display their products/services and engage with clients online, correct?
                        Now, what's the purpose of a portfolio site? Again, to showcase products/services and connect
                        with clients digitally, right? Is there any discernible difference? I believe not. That's the
                        difference between a competent developer and an insightful one. Truth be told, anyone can code a
                        website, even AI can automate the process. However, not everyone can enhance it with the level
                        of intelligence required to truly stand out. Choose wisely.</p>
